After completing her PhD "Investigation of the effect of Wild type and mutant NF-kB related proteins on mesoderm induction in Xenopus" she began work as a postdoc in Prof Jonathan Slack's lab at the University of Bath, where she worked on tailbud development, gamma-secretases (briefly), transgenic techniques and tail regeneration. Caroline moved to New Zealand in 2004 to start her own lab at University of Otago. She teaches Genetics and Zoology and was Director of Genetics from mid 2017 to the end of 2020.
