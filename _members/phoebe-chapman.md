Phoebe joined the lab in August 2020, originally working from Queensland, Australia due to pandemic border issues. She relocated to Otago in March 2021. She has a BSc Hons and PhD from the University of Queensland, where she worked on parasitic diseases in sea turtles.

Phoebe is a member of Genetics Otago and uses molecular genetic and bioinformatic approaches to ask interesting questions about the tadpole microbiome origins and to investigate whether the skin microbiome can influence regenerative success.
