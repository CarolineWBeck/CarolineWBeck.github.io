Sulagna is from Kolkata in India and has an MSc in Medical Genetics from University of Glasgow (Scotland) and a PhD in Genetics from University of Otago. She completed her PhD with us in 2023, where she  developed a new model of intractable epilepsy and used this to test anti inflammatory compounds for their ability to reduce seizure activity. 

Sulagna's postdoctoral research is funded by the [Neurological Foundation of New Zealand.](https://neurological.org.nz/research/). Her work involves CRISPR/Cas9 editing of DEE genes in tadpoles, behavioural analysis, drug testing and analysis of brain activity.
